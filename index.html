      <h1 id="HIS">How it Started</h1>
      <p class="articletext">I was given a yellow car transporter for my 8th birthday.  For the previous 2 years, I had been building layouts with my friend’s sets and was really excited to now have my own assets.<br> <br>Fast forward several years to January of 2018 and I started making YouTube videos about my own creations(MOCs) and opinions on sets that Lego had made.  I used a small IKEA desk in my room to film videos and I would upload weekly if not more.  In May, I would be able to get a dedicated space in the garage for Lego with two large tables.  I planned to keep one empty for making videos and the other to fulfill my dream of a large Lego City display.  As I built more MOCs, I got one more to now have a large surface for designing and connecting urban creations.</p>
      <h1 id="5YOB">5 Years of Building</h1>
      <p class="articletext">To construct a city from scratch you need to have some sort of plan or strategy.  At the time I started Brick City, I was 12 years old.  I decided to start by creating a large train loop that outlined the two tables I would build on.  This train loop would serve as the foundation for where roads and buildings would eventually be.</p>
      <div class="imagerow">
        <img src="timelinepics/2road&1greenbaseplatesoverview.PNG">
      </div>
      <p class="articletext">As seen in the pictures above, I started with some official Lego vehicles that my brother and I already had.  To create strong interconnections within the city, large 32x32 stud base plates would be built on.  We just had four plates at the time, two road baseplates, a larger 48x48 gray baseplate, and one green grass.  On the gray plate, I created an empty but functional cargo rail yard with an overhead crane and two parallel tracks.</p>
      <div class="imagerow">
        <img src="timelinepics/cargotrainyard.PNG">
        <img src="timelinepics/policestationwith3baseplates.PNG">
      </div>
      <p class="articletext">The police station was the first building to be placed in the city and although it was later modified, it remained in its original spot for the final city layout.  The images below show more green base plates being added, expanding from the police station.</p>
      <div class="imagerow">
        <img src="timelinepics/planeplateswithbluetracksection.PNG">
        <img src="timelinepics/somewhatemptyparkwbluecar&2trees.PNG">
      </div>
      <p class="articletext">In January 2019, I gave the cargo area a makeover.  Keeping the overall layout, I was able to add a smooth tarmac with tile pieces.  I also added a small control/office building where documents for the cargo yard could be stored.  The roof was easily removable for access to the finished interior.  The following images show these improvements:</p>

        <img src="timelinepics/cargoareabuildinginside.PNG">
      </div>
      <p class="articletext">Next, residential assets were built such as The Central Park.  The Central Park follows the rails and is across the street from two houses which were also added.</p>
      <div class="imagerow">
        <img src="timelinepics/cityoverviewlookingtowallchairbottomofframe.PNG">
      </div>
      <p class="articletext">January also brought three houses to the city seen below.  The house on the left was completely custom.  With a two-story design, many features give this house character; a rooftop garden, air conditioning unit, planters in front of windows, and the front facade at a slight angle.  The light gray sidewalk out front is intended to give a clue of new construction.  A movie star lives in the house in the center image.  Originally a Lego Friends set, it was integrated with a tree and special landscaping.  The final house shown below is an official modern house set with little details added to bring it to life.  One such detail is the crook using parkour to exit the skylight after robbing the likely rich residents.</p>

      <p class="articletext">In February, I focused on developing the east side.  Here the official Lego hospital set was added(see images below).  This set looked amazing but needed to incorporate more details and a lively environment.  So a beach was built next to the hospital.  A wooden boardwalk with glass railings separates the beach from the hospital.  The hospital is raised several bricks and has a ramp up to the ambulance bay from the street.  The hospital was the first Lego set to be purchased specifically for Brick City.  I was always happy with how the white and red worked alongside the beach.</p>

        <img src="timelinepics/hospitalareaslopewithplant&lightuppost.PNG">
      </div>
      <p class="articletext">Now the city was starting to feel alive!  I was adding lots of minifigures and creating stories with their interactions.</p>
      <div class="imagerow">
        <img src="timelinepics/parktakenfrompizzatruck.PNG">
        <img src="timelinepics/browhairorderspizza.PNG">
      </div>
      <p class="articletext">Lots of details played a role in the City feeling whole.  The beach water got more texture, and so did the train rails:</p>

        <img src="timelinepics/traintrackstexture.PNG">
      </div>
      <p class="articletext">In March 2019, the City was going vertical!  Both the movie star house and police stations received additional stories on top as well as new roof designs.  The images below show these improvements and how I could match the existing architecture while making the new additions seem different.</p>
      <div class="imagerow">

      </div>
      <p class="articletext">This version of the city is one of my favorites because of the cargo train yard.  The Lego trains are nostalgic to me, and the cargo area was a great way to feature trains within the detailed city.</p>
      <div class="imagerow">
        <img src="timelinepics/cityoverviewredhelicopter.PNG">
      </div>
      <p class="articletext">Lots of changes were made over the coming years.  The images below show a few of these changes.  The police station was now home to a massive three-story tall tree.  The small coffee shop behind the police station now neighbored a convenience store.  And more road base plates were added with sidewalks not constructed until months later due to parts shortages.</p>
      <div class="imagerow">

      <p class="articletext">Looking back, it interests me how the development of Brick City followed a similar process to the evolution of real cities.  The first buildings develop(police station), then more buildings are built sprawling outwards.  The original buildings are improved and usually grow taller.  This was the same case in Brick City.  The police station eventually got an additional floor on top, and the sibling tower was built beside it.  Even surrounding residential buildings would all get added floors.</p>
